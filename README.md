# Flex Creek

Flex Creek is a workout tracker. It's meant to serve as a workout log as well as a repository of potential movements and workouts to use in the future.

## Planning

Next steps should roughly be:

1. Finish DB services
2. API endpoints
3. HTML endpoints
4. Authentication (including user registration & activation via email?)
5. Logging
6. Testing
